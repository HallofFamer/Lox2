# Lox2
A superset of Lox with ByteCode Interpreter, with multi-pass compiler, optional type checker and tons of new features.


## Introduction
Lox2 is an extended version of the programming language Lox in C. It has new features such as namespace system, exception handling, async/await and optional static typing. The future versions of Lox2 will continue to add more useful features, with improvement of the type system as top priority.

The original version of Lox programming language can be found at Bob Nystrom's repository:
https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters


## Features

### Original Features from Lox
- Stacked based bytecode VM with the basic OPCode support.
- On-demand Scanner, Pratt Parser and Single-Pass Compiler.
- Uniform runtime representation for Lox Value. 
- Basic Unary and Binary Expression/Operators.
- Support for global and local variables.
- If..Else and Switch condition Statement.
- While Loop, Break and Continue Statement.
- Functions and Closures with automatic upvalue capture.
- Mark and sweep Garbage Collector.
- Classes, Objects, Methods and `this` keyword.
- Single Inheritance and `super` keyword.
- Performance improvement with Faster hash table probing and Nan-Boxing.

### New Features in Lox2
- Framework for creating native functions, methods and classes.
- Array/Dictionary Literals and square bracket notation for array/dictionary access.
- New Operators: Modulo(`%`), Range(`..`) and Nil Handling(`?.`, `??`, `?:`).
- Operator overloading to allow operators to be treated as method calls, thus can be used by user defined classes.
- Variadic Functions, Anonymous Functions(local return) and Lambda Expressions(nonlocal return).
- `Object` root class for every class in Lox, everything is an object, and every object has a class.
- Object ID and generic object map which enable inheritance for special build-in classes such as `String` and `Array`.
- Class methods in class declaration using `class` keyword, and trait declaration using `trait` keyword.
- Anonymous classes/traits similar to anonymous functions/lambda.
- Namespace as CLox's module system, allowing importing namespace and aliasing of imported classes, traits and functions.
- CLox Standard Library for packages `lang`, `util`, `collection`, `io` and `net` in bullt-in namespace `clox.std`.
- Raise exception with `throw` keyword, and exception handling with try/catch/finally statement.
- Interceptor methods which are invoked automatically when getting/setting properties, invoking methods or throwing exceptions.
- Generator functions/methods which can yield control back to the caller and resume at a later point of execution.
- Promise API with event loop provided by libuv library for non-blocking IO operations.
- Introduction of `async` and `await` keywords, which allows C#/JS style of concurrency.
- Optional static typing support for function/method parameters and return values, types only exist at compile time and are erased at runtime. 
- Semicolon inference as well as basic type inference for immutable local/global variables. 
- Customized Runtime configuration for CLox using clox.ini.
- Allow loading lox source files in lox script and another lox source file with `require` keyword.
- Cross-platform build with Cmake and package manager with vcpkg.

### Enhanced or Removed Features
- VM is no longer a global variable, allowing CLox VM to be embedded in other host applications.
- Multi-pass compiler with abstract syntax tree, semantic analyzer(resolver), symbol table, type checker, and generation of bytecode by walking AST. 
- Parser is extended with look-ahead capability, with field next storing the next token. 
- Print statement removed, use native function `print` and `println` instead.
- Initializer method is renamed from `init` to `__init__` as an interceptor method.
- Separated integer values(`Int`) and floating point(`Float`) values from `Number`.
- Improved string concatenation, addition of string interpolation and UTF-8 strings.
- C style For Loop replaced with Python/Kotlin style for-in Loop.
- Introduction of keyword `extends` instead of using `<` operator for class inheritance.
- Global variables are scoped within the file it is declared, effectively becoming module variable.
- Function/Method parameters become immutable by default, but may be mutable with `var` keyword.
- Built-in and user defined classes/functions become immutable, and cannot be accidentally overwritten.
- Fix reentrancy problem with CLox, calling Lox closures in C API becomes possible.
- Most runtime errors in VM interpreter loop replaced with Exceptions that can be caught at runtime.
- Inline caching for VM optimization, as well as implementation of Shape(Hidden Class) for better instance variable representation.
- Upgraded the mark and sweep GC with a generational GC which has multiple regions for objects of various generations, which leads to GC running faster when marking/freeing objects. 

## Roadmap

Below are the features planned for future versions of Lox2, the list is subject to change but it gives a basic idea of the future directions of this project. 

For a list of implemented features, please see the change logs in /notes directory.

### Lox2 2.1.0(next version)
- Extend parser with infinite lookahead, allowing qualified names to be used for function/method signature, class/trait declaration and catch statement.
- Dedicated syntax for declaring function types and metaclass types, enabling anonymous functions/lambda to be typed. 
- Allow declaration of object properties outside of class initializer, which also enables optional static typing.
- Redesign of Iterator/Enumerator API for ease of use and implementation of iterable types.

### Lox2 2.2.0
- Enhanced type system with basic support for generics/parametric polymorphism.
- `type` keyword used as declaration of type alias, useful for complex generic types.
- Capability of saving bytecode into disk as .loxo file, which can be loaded later for faster compilation.
- Refactor classes in the existing standard library to use generics(in `clox.std` parent package), such as `Array<T>` and `Promise<T>`.

### Lox2 2.3.0
- Additional type system enhancement for union types, with `|` operator on types such as `String | Number`.
- Support for structural pattern matching using `match` keyword, remove `switch` statement as it has been superceded.
- Improved type system with non-nullable by default for type declaration, as well as variance for method parameter/return types.
- Trailing closure similar to Kotlin and Swift which allows last lambda argument to be placed outside of parenthesis.

### Lox2 2.4.0
- Refine `if` and `match` as expressions, with the value produced being the last expression/statement of the expression body. 
- Object literal syntax similar to Javascript which can be good for configuration objects. 
- Add new package `clox.std.text` which handles text processing for MIME types such as json and xml.
- Foreign function interface(FFI) as a way to write CLox libraries in C and load in lox script.

### Lox2 2.5.0
- C# style property accessor syntax, also inline simple getter/setter calls. 
- First class continuation with keyword `context`, enabling manipulation of call stack in userland.
- Add CLox CLI to run Lox scripts easily from command line, backed by libuv. 
- Implement a profiler which can identify the "Hotspots" of the program and how long they execute, prerequiste for future JIT. 


## Build and Run Clox

```
git clone -b master https://github.com/HallofFamer/CLox.git

## FAQ

#### What is the purpose of this project?
Lox2 is an implementation of Lox language with bytecode VM instead of treewalk interpreter. It is the last experiment on feature implementations, before I will begin writing my own programming language `Mysidia` in C. It serves as an education and experimental language, yet it is meant to be production ready instead of being a toy language. 

#### What are the reasons behind the design of Lox2?
Please see DESIGN.md document for more information, it provides a detailed explanation on the choice of new features being implemented, as well as insights into the evolution of Lox2 as a general purpose programming language.

#### Can I use the code of Lox2 as base for my own project?
This project is open source and the codebase can be used as base for someone else's project. It has an MIT license, and attribution must be given except for code from the original Lox implementation or third party libraries.

#### What will happen to KtLox?
Nothing, KtLox development is on hold until I can figure out a way to generate JVM bytecode instead of running the interpreter by walking down the AST. Treewalk interpreters are way too slow to be practical without JIT, and in my honest opinion I do not think the book should've covered treewalk interpreters but I will digress.
