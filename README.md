# Lox2
A superset of Lox with ByteCode Interpreter, with multi-pass compiler, optional type checker and tons of new features.


## Introduction
Lox2 is an extended version of the programming language Lox in C. It has new features such as namespace system, exception handling, async/await and optional static typing. The future versions of Lox2 will continue to add more useful features, with improvement of the type system as top priority.

The original version of Lox programming language can be found at Bob Nystrom's repository:

## Features

### Original Features from Lox
- Stacked based bytecode VM with the basic OPCode support.
- On-demand Scanner, Pratt Parser and Single-Pass Compiler.
- Uniform runtime representation for Lox Value. 
- Basic Unary and Binary Expression/Operators.
- Support for global and local variables.
- If..Else and Switch condition Statement.
- While Loop, Break and Continue Statement.
- Functions and Closures with automatic upvalue capture.
- Mark and sweep Garbage Collector.
- Classes, Objects, Methods and `this` keyword.
- Single Inheritance and `super` keyword.
- Performance improvement with Faster hash table probing and Nan-Boxing.

### New Features in Lox2
- Framework for creating native functions, methods and classes.
- Array/Dictionary Literals and square bracket notation for array/dictionary access.
- New Operators: Modulo(`%`), Range(`..`) and Nil Handling(`?.`, `??`, `?:`).
- Operator overloading to allow operators to be treated as method calls, thus can be used by user defined classes.
- Variadic Functions, Anonymous Functions(local return) and Lambda Expressions(nonlocal return).
- `Object` root class for every class in Lox, everything is an object, and every object has a class.
- Object ID and generic object map which enable inheritance for special build-in classes such as `String` and `Array`.
- Class methods in class declaration using `class` keyword, which are actually instance methods defined on metaclasses.
- Trait declaration using trait keyword, as well as implementing trait via with keyword.
- Anonymous classes/traits similar to anonymous functions/lambda.
- Namespace as Lox2's module system, allowing importing namespace and aliasing of imported classes, traits and functions.
- Lox2 Standard Library for packages `lang`, `util`, `collection`, `io` and `net` in bullt-in namespace `clox.std`.
- Raise exception with `throw` keyword, and exception handling with try/catch/finally statement.
- Interceptor methods which are invoked automatically when getting/setting properties, invoking methods or throwing exceptions.
- Generator functions/methods which can yield control back to the caller and resume at a later point of execution.
- Promise API with event loop provided by libuv library for non-blocking IO operations.
- Introduction of `async` and `await` keywords, which allows C#/JS style of concurrency.
- Optional static typing support for function/method parameters and return values, types only exist at compile time and are erased at runtime. 
- Semicolon inference as well as basic type inference for immutable local/global variables. 
- Customized Runtime configuration for Lox2 using lox2.ini.
- Allow loading lox source files in lox script and another lox source file with `require` keyword.
- Cross-platform build with Cmake and package manager with vcpkg.

### Enhanced or Removed Features
- VM is no longer a global variable, allowing Lox2 VM to be embedded in other host applications.
- Multi-pass compiler with abstract syntax tree, semantic analyzer(resolver), symbol table, type checker, and generation of bytecode by walking AST. 
- Parser is extended with look-ahead capability, with field next storing the next token. 
- Print statement removed, use native function `print` and `println` instead.
- Initializer method is renamed from `init` to `__init__` as an interceptor method.
- Separated integer values(`Int`) and floating point(`Float`) values from `Number`.
- Improved string concatenation, addition of string interpolation and UTF-8 strings.
- C style For Loop replaced with Python/Kotlin style for-in Loop.
- Introduction of keyword `extends` instead of using `<` operator for class inheritance.
- Global variables are scoped within the file it is declared, effectively becoming module variable.
- Function/Method parameters become immutable by default, but may be mutable with `var` keyword.
- Built-in and user defined classes/functions become immutable, and cannot be accidentally overwritten.
- Fix reentrancy problem with Lox2, calling Lox2 closures in C API becomes possible.
- Most runtime errors in VM interpreter loop replaced with Exceptions that can be caught at runtime.
- Inline caching for VM optimization, as well as implementation of Shape(Hidden Class) for better instance variable representation.
- Upgraded the mark and sweep GC with a generational GC which has multiple regions for objects of various generations, which leads to GC running faster when marking/freeing objects. 


## Documentation
[Lox2's documentation](https://mysidia-inc.gitbook.io/lox2) can be found on gitbook, which explores the features in Lox2 as well as some concrete example Lox2 programs. It is still a work in progress as the standard library reference and VM internals sections are still under construction. 

At this moment only the web version is available, though in Lox2 v2.1.0 onwards, Lox2 may have PDF documentation to download for interested developers. 


## Roadmap

Below are the features planned for future versions of Lox2, the list is subject to change but it gives a basic idea of the future directions of this project. 

For a list of implemented features, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/HallofFamer/Lox2/blob/master/notes/CHANGELOG.md).

### Lox2 v2.1.0(next version)
- Extend parser with infinite lookahead, allowing qualified names to be used for function/method signature, class/trait declaration and catch statement.
- Dedicated syntax for declaring function types and metaclass types, enabling anonymous functions/lambda to be typed. 
- Allow declaration of object properties outside of class initializer, which also enables optional static typing.
- Redesign of Iterator/Enumerator API for ease of use and implementation of iterable types.

### Lox2 v2.2.0
- Enhanced type system with basic support for generics/parametric polymorphism.
- `type` keyword used as declaration of type alias, useful for complex generic types.
- Capability of saving bytecode into disk as .loxo file, which can be loaded later for faster compilation.
- Refactor classes in the existing standard library to use generics(in `clox.std` parent package), such as `Array<T>` and `Promise<T>`.

### Lox2 v2.3.0
- Additional type system enhancement for union types, with `|` operator on types such as `String | Number`.
- Add new namespace `clox.ext` which may be optionally enabled/disabled in lox2.ini, add new package `clox.ext.text` for text processing.
- Improved type system with non-nullable by default for type declaration, as well as variance for method parameter/return types.
- Trailing closure similar to Kotlin and Swift which allows last lambda argument to be placed outside of parenthesis.

### Lox2 v2.4.0
- Support for structural pattern matching using `match` keyword, remove `switch` statement as it has been superceded.
- Enhanced Generics/parametric polymorphism with constraints on generic type parameters using `extends` or `with` keywords.
- Object literal syntax similar to Javascript which can be good for configuration objects. 
- Foreign function interface(FFI) as a way to write Lox2 libraries in C and load in lox script.

### Lox2 v2.5.0
- C# style property accessor syntax which provides a flexible way to access and modify the value of instance fields. 
- Add new package `clox.ext.sql` which supports database connections and queries for mysql/mariadb, postgres, sqlite, etc.
- Add Lox2 CLI to run Lox scripts easily from command line, backed by libuv. 
- Implement a profiler which can identify the "Hotspots" of the program and how long they execute, prerequiste for future JIT. 

### Lox2 v2.6.0
- Initial implementation of tracing JIT compiler that optimizes hot loops, only for x64 architecture. 
- First class continuation with keyword `thisContext`, enabling manipulation of call stack in userland.
- Refine `if` and `match` as expressions, with the value produced being the last expression/statement of the expression body.
- Add new package `clox.ext.gui` which supports writing GUI applications using gtk binding for Lox2.


## Example
The following code shows how to send a simple asynchronous HTTP request and prints its status and contents to the console. This example makes uses of various features from Lox2 such as namespace declaration/import, immutable variable, async/await, and string interpolation. 

```
namespace Lox2Example
using clox.std.net.HTTPClient
using clox.std.net.URL

val client = HTTPClient()
val response = await client.getAsync(URL.parse("https://example.com"))
println("Response Status: ${response.status}")
println("Content: ${response.content}")
```


## Build and Run Lox2

#### Windows(with git, cmake and vcpkg, need to replace [$VCPKG_PATH] with installation path of vcpkg)
```
git clone -b v2.0.2 https://github.com/HallofFamer/Lox2.git
cd Lox2
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE:STRING="[$VCPKG_PATH]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -S . -B ./build
cmake --build ./build --config Release
./x64/Release/Lox2
```

#### Linux(with git, cmake, curl and libuv, need to install one of the libcurl4-dev and libuv1.dev packages)
```
git clone -b v2.0.2 https://github.com/HallofFamer/Lox2.git
cd Lox2
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B ./build
cmake --build ./build --config Release
./build/Lox2
```

#### Docker(linux, need to replace [$LinuxDockerfile] by actual docker file name, ie. UbuntuDockerfile)
```
git clone -b v2.0.2 https://github.com/HallofFamer/Lox2.git
cd Lox2
docker build -t lox2:linux -f Docker/[$LinuxDockerfile] .
docker run -w /Lox2-2.0.2/Lox2 -i -t lox2:linux
```

Note: It is recommended to clone from the latest stable release branch("v2.0.1" at this moment), as the master branch receives updates regularly and some changes may break existing code.
